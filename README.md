## Rust-Chat-Client
> Chat-client-application for my [Go-Chat-App](https://github.com/F4c3hugg3r/Go-Chat-App) server-side. It's written purely in **Rust**. 

### Featuring: 
- a **T**erminal**UI** made with the ratatui crate
- **Tabs** for user and help management
- **chatrooms** to join and chat in
- **input-history** and more

It can be cross compiled and grants storage- as well as threadsafety due to its Rust nature.
